I want this as the intake procedure:
1) a separate image for numberplate. this is the image that will be used by vision ai to extract the numberplate. 
2) A series of images that will be taken from different angles to be used by vision ai to extract the vehicle type. We will also use the image to decipher any damage to the vehicle. 
3) All intake images will be attached to the order in the database. You will need an intake collection.

'Then on delivery, we will have a separate delivery collection that will have images attached to it.
We will take pictures.
Again they will be inspected for any new damage, comparing with the intake images.
If found a alert will popup

the delivery collection will also have the following fields:
1) Battery status
2) Tyre condition
3) Tyre pressure
4) Engine status
5) Rim condition
6) Any other recommendations
This should be present on the order so that we can updated it any time.

Open orders can be edited at any time.
Payment links also can be edited at any time.
Only orders that are paid cannot be edited.
